    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>
        This project was completed as part of the University of Central Florida’s Black and Gold Analytics club.
        I worked as a team member to analyze datasets using Python and spreadsheet tools.
        The project involved collecting data from online sources and organizing it into Excel files
        to prepare it for analysis and collaboration.
