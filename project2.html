    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>
        This project was completed for a Human Computer Interaction course at the University of Central Florida.
        My group and I designed a mobile application concept intended to help UCF students discover and engage
        with campus clubs and organizations.

    <p>
        Using Figma, we created interactive wireframes and visual designs focused on usability, accessibility,
        and an intuitive user experience.
